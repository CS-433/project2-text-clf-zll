Run notebooks in google drive and change the file names in training or test file paths.

The best result (from BERT model) is uploaded in the submission_bert_100000.csv, the accuracy rate is 86.8%.

Preprocessed data can be recreated using preprocessing_totxt.ipynb and preprocessing_tocsv.ipynb. Use different preprocessing forms to adapt to different models.
